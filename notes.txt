-input values are not propegating to the paramters at first.. when the node is created
-saving not 100% anymore

-my console needs updating and allow me to print things to it
-console can have pinned inputs too.. like position

- look at marquee select (multiple canvas layers)
- marquee needs to look at negative value dragging
- make a compound
- copy and paste
- delete a node
- ability to rename a node

#script class
	-find_node
