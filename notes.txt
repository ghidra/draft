#where i left off
- basic render path working!
- look at having multiple passthrough ports
	-create new passthrough on connect
- ability to disconnect connections by draggin backwards
	-on backwards drag, disconnect connection if connected
-when rendering, i only check if we are a string or object
	-maybe need to consider if its a dom element specifically

#-----rad
-panels
	-adding panels re-draws everything, deleting any content inside the partitions.
	-I need to store any elements inside the partition before redrawing

#----------draft
#parameters
	-on window resize, I need to update the dimensions
	-i need to get new dimensions when its opned up again.
	-currently dimensions are save the first time a parameter panel is created
	-check if parameter we want to create is already created, so that we dont create it again redundantly

#script class
	-find_node
		-add ability to return a list of found nodes of a type and label if no id given
		-currently I return the first found
		-allow both behaviors

#editor render
	-parameter changes update editor render
	-render move to new object
		-render recursion needs thought, and work
		-now that render stores value, consider a cache system
		-when attribut changes i dont have to re-evaluate everything

#-----nodes
node type color
node infiniate recursion commnection needs to be checked

#-----lines
wires only get to connect once, if connected elsewhere, the old one is removed
ability to dissconect wires
paramter needs to check if there is something plugged in, so it doesnt show it
deal with the inputs.passthrough value to make extendable ports

//---------- UI

my right padding on drop downs is missing
i might need to label ports (boo)
input string windows, hopefully easliy expandable
maybe one day, i need to add another array on nodes, so I can get more specific with unput type data 	ie ints floats long string short strings
input types:
	strings
	booleans
	vectors
	matrices
	colors
	ramps
	gradient

a way to give colors to groupds of nodes.
port colors should also reflect the type of data

nav map

marquee selection

upstream selection. downstream selection
