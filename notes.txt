resize window function to update drawing of resizers and spliters
-my first attempt calls draw which re-draws everything and this, deletes any content inside the partitions.
-I need to store any elements inside the partition before redrawing--that will be an entire other undertaking

#----------
#parameters
	-check if parameter we want to create is already created, so that we dont create it again redundantly

#script class
find_node
	-add ability to return a list of all the found nodes of a type and label if no id given
	-currently I return the first found
	-allow both behaviors

#editor render
	-parameter changes update editor render
	-render move to new object
		-render recursion needs thought, and work
		-at the moment, it returns the first value found
		-i need to pipe values in and keep them to retrieve later
		-maybe I need a attribute on node, that holds the render_output.
			-also so that I can query if that has changed so that I dont need to render everything all the time

#-----nodes
node type color
node infiniate recursion commnection needs to be checked

#-----lines
wires only get to connect once, if connected elsewhere, the old one is removed
ability to dissconect wires
paramter needs to check if there is something plugged in, so it doesnt show it
deal with the inputs.passthrough value to make extendable ports

//---------- UI

my right padding on drop downs is missing
i might need to label ports (boo)
input string windows, hopefully easliy expandable
maybe one day, i need to add another array on nodes, so I can get more specific with unput type data 	ie ints floats long string short strings
input types:
	strings
	booleans
	vectors
	matrices
	colors
	ramps
	gradient

a way to give colors to groupds of nodes.
port colors should also reflect the type of data

nav map

marquee selection

upstream selection. downstream selection
