paramter needs to check if there is something plugged in, so it doesnt show it

deal with the inputs.passthrough value to make extendable ports

//---------- UI

my right padding on drop downs is missing
i might need to label ports (boo)
input string windows, hopefully easliy expandable
maybe one day, i need to add another array on nodes, so I can get more specific with unput type data 	ie ints floats long string short strings
input types:
	strings
	booleans
	vectors
	matrices
	colors
	ramps
	gradient

a way to give colors to groupds of nodes.
port colors should also reflect the type of data

----

basic canvas navigation
so you can zoom in zoom out and move around

node infiniate recursion commnection needs to be checked

//---------- terminal

each terminal should beable to generate a new layer in the doc that it can render to
each script can have multiple terminals

render data

terminal node needs a way to see results
