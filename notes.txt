#where i left off
- nodes, get downstream and upstream
 	-that will allows us to keep from doing infinite connections
 	-this will allow setting cache oudated or not
- cache rendered data
- look at having multiple passthrough ports
	-create new passthrough on connect
- ability to disconnect connections by draggin backwards
	-on backwards drag, disconnect connection if connected
- ability to rename a node

#-----rad
-panels
	-adding panels re-draws everything, deleting any content inside the partitions.
	-I need to store any elements inside the partition before redrawing

#----------draft
#parameters
- paramter needs to check if there is something plugged in, so it doesnt
#script class
	-find_node
		-add ability to return a list of found nodes of a type and label if no id given
		-currently I return the first found
		-allow both behaviors

#editor render
	-parameter changes update editor render
	-render move to new object
		-render recursion needs thought, and work
		-now that render stores value, consider a cache system
		-when attribut changes i dont have to re-evaluate everything

#-----nodes
node type color
node infiniate recursion commnection needs to be checked

#-----lines
wires only get to connect once, if connected elsewhere, the old one is removed
ability to dissconect wires
deal with the inputs.passthrough value to make extendable ports

//---------- UI

my right padding on drop downs is missing
input string windows, hopefully easliy expandable

input types:
	colors
	ramps
	gradient

nav map
marquee selection
upstream selection. downstream selection
copy and paste
