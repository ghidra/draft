#where i left off

-render does not compile all the passthroughts together, just uses the first one
-generic node render, doesnt not get the right "tag" it comes out "undefined"

-PORTS AWARE OF MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS
-when a line is created, if its from an out port, I need to add to the lines variable. so I can loop it later
-as it is now, ports only know of the last line created to it, so an outport, which might have more than one, is unaware

-basic recursion testing working
	-but if a port has more than one connectoin it might fail, since it is really only aware of a single connection line
	-i need a port to be able to know how many times it is connected, specifically an outport
	-in ports can only have a single connection

-my console needs updating and allow me to print things to it
-console can have pinned inputs too.. like position

- nodes, get downstream and upstream
 	-that will allows us to keep from doing infinite connections
 	-this will allow setting cache oudated or not
- look at marquee select (multiple canvas layers)
- make a compound
- copy and paste
- delete a node
- cache rendered data
- ability to rename a node

#-----rad
-panels
	-adding panels re-draws everything, deleting any content inside the partitions.
	-I need to store any elements inside the partition before redrawing

#----------draft
#parameters
- paramter needs to check if there is something plugged in, so it doesnt
#script class
	-find_node
		-add ability to return a list of found nodes of a type and label if no id given
		-currently I return the first found
		-allow both behaviors

#editor render
	-parameter changes update editor render
	-render move to new object
		-render recursion needs thought, and work
		-now that render stores value, consider a cache system
		-when attribut changes i dont have to re-evaluate everything

#-----nodes
node type color
node infiniate recursion commnection needs to be checked

#-----lines
wires only get to connect once, if connected elsewhere, the old one is removed
ability to dissconect wires
deal with the inputs.passthrough value to make extendable ports

//---------- UI

my right padding on drop downs is missing
input string windows, hopefully easliy expandable

input types:
	colors
	ramps
	gradient

nav map
marquee selection
upstream selection. downstream selection
copy and paste
